description: Home for resources on modularity, work by <a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/annenberg-public-policy-center-distinguished-research-fellows/">Distinguished Fellow</a> Susan Ness and Distinguished Research Fellow Chris Riley with the <a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/">Annenberg Public Policy Center</a> of the University of Pennsylvania.<br><br><strong>The Urgent Case for Modularity</strong><br>Modularity is a co-regulatory construct for multistakeholder, multi-jurisdictional digital platform governance, despite different legal systems, regulatory time-frames, and societal norms. Modules are common, cross-border building blocks that further regulatory goals.<br>Today modularity thrives in other industries.<br>It makes little sense for democracies to deploy multiple systems to execute the same function, such as vetting researchers for platform data access.  It wastes resources and deters smaller platforms with limited funds. Moreover, cross-border multistakeholder modules are more dynamically adaptive, and can be updated more rapidly than regulation or a treaty.<br><strong>The timing is immediate.</strong> New digital governance structures are rapidly emerging worldwide. While the underlying values may align, many of the rules are duplicative or conflicting, wasting regulatory resources, and creating confusion for industry and users alike.<br>Modularity is the timely and appropriate solution to this conflict.
