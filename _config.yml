Modules are common, cross-border building blocks that further regulatory goals.<br><br>New digital governance structures are rapidly emerging worldwide. While the underlying values may align, many of the rules are duplicative or conflicting, wasting regulatory resources, and creating confusion for industry and users alike.<br><br><strong>Modularity</strong> is the timely and appropriate solution to this conflict.
