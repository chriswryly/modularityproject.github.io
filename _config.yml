description: Home for resources on modularity, work by <a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/annenberg-public-policy-center-distinguished-research-fellows/">Distinguished Fellow</a> Susan Ness and Distinguished Research Fellow Chris Riley with the <a href="https://www.annenbergpublicpolicycenter.org/">Annenberg Public Policy Center</a> of the University of Pennsylvania.<br><br><strong>The Urgent Case for Modularity</strong><br>Our mission is to reorient policymakers toward multi-jurisdictional, multistakeholder solutions when initially designing regulatory frameworks and rules for online services. It will better align democracies, lessen internet fragmentation, and reduce regulatory costs for government, platforms and users.<br>Modularity is a co-regulatory construct for multistakeholder, multi-jurisdictional digital platform governance, despite different legal systems, regulatory time-frames, and societal norms. Modules are common, cross-border building blocks that further regulatory goals.<br>Today modularity thrives in other industries. Both the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) that oversees international accounting standards, and FINRA, the non-profit board that sets standards and licenses Wall Street brokers and dealers, have modular structures.<br>Multistakeholder modules could (1) draft and monitor codes of conduct; (2) draft minimum standards and oversee protocols for independent auditors reviewing a platformâ€™s risk assessment and mitigation efforts; and (3) draft standards and operate a cross-border system for vetting researchers and research projects seeking access to platform data.<br>It makes little sense for democracies to deploy multiple systems to execute the same function, such as vetting researchers for platform data access.  It wastes resources and deters smaller platforms with limited funds. Moreover, cross-border multistakeholder modules are more dynamically adaptive, and can be updated more rapidly than regulation or a treaty.<br><strong>The timing is immediate.</strong> New digital governance structures are rapidly emerging worldwide.  The European Commission is drafting delegated acts to implement the Digital Services Act; Ofcom is seeking guidance on codes to implement the pending U.K. Online Safety Bill; the New Zealand Government is considering revising its online safety rules; Canada is working on legislation, and the U.S. Congress is debating bills that overlap with portions of European law. Also, the UN Digital Envoy, UNESCO and Council of Europe are proposing separate digital governance frameworks.  While the underlying values may align, many of the rules are duplicative or conflicting, wasting regulatory resources, and creating confusion for industry and users alike.
